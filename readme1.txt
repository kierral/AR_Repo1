Hi Team! I am a senior technical analyst on the Platform Operations Support team. We provide solutions regarding technical issues of the platform to internal and external customers.

I signed up for Lucid Codes to see learn coding so that I can better understand the different API integrated applications that me and my team work or used to work on.

After, I finish the course I  look forward to working and developing some applications for Integrating with the Platform to ease operations. Also, want to work and understand the security features like  SCCB from a technical perspective.

Hi Team! I am a senior technical analyst on the Platform Operations Support team. We provide solutions regarding technical issues of the platform to internal and external customers.

I signed up for Lucid Codes to see learn coding so that I can better understand the different API integrated applications that me and my team work or used to work on.

After, I finish the course I  look forward to working and developing some applications for Integrating with the Platform to ease operations. Also, want to work and understand the security features like  SCCB from a technical perspective.
From Klaube: It sounds like through learning coding, you will be able to develop APIs that will drive efficiency in your team! It would be awesome if your projects could help to streamline operational tasks.
